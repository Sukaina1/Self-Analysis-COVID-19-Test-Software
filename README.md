# **Self-Analysis-COVID-19-Test-Software**

The project is specifically designed for institutes, in order to keep the COVID-19 result status and make students and teachers aware about their situation. First of all, software asks the userâ€™s general data, like name, age, blood group and vaccination information. Afterwards, user is asked 5 questions. As the user answers the questions, a report is formulated using the input data and a record is saved whether the user is COVID-19 positive or COVID-19 negative.  

**Project Description:**

The project is based upon binary-tree data structure. The project was built using Python. In this program, the user is asked some questions, which the user has to answer. After that, a conclusion is made and displayed based upon the answers. And a report is displayed.

**Project Features:**

=> Operating System: Windows

=> Data Structure: Binary Tree

=> Programming Language: Python

=> Number of code lines: 349




**Time Complexity:**

=> The time complexity of going from one question to another is O(1).

=> The time complexity of starting the questionnaire till the result is shown is O(n).

**How to run the program:**

Download and open 'Self-Analysis COVID-19 Test Software.py'. Copy and Run the program in any Python compiler.
